# The command line is a space for your instructions. Like a whiteboard, you can only use whiteboard markers on it. These whiteboard markers are different commands. You must use the right command for your instructions. The command line is different to how most people use computers because it is just text. You make files move or create files by using different commands rather than using your mouse. The command line is not as pretty but it's just a different way of doing things.
